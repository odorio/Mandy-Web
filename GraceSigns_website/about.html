        <h1>Our Story</h1>
        <div class="slide_p">
        <p> Sign Me A Story is an innovative app series developed by GraceSigns, founded by Valerie R. Carter. GraceSigns is a non-profit organization with a mission of making language FUN and EASY for ALL kids.</p>
        <p> The inspiration stemmed from Valerie's daughter Grace who has Down Syndrome. As a young child, Grace could not express herself. She had great difficulty and would often come home from school, unable to talk about her day. Valerie and Grace were both equally frustrated by their lack of language, so together they began to learn sign language. Finally they were able communicate! GraceSigns has a very simple goal - to give kids of all ages and abilities, the gift of language.</p>
